Algorithm for a UDP Server That Receives and Sends Messages
Step 1: Initialize the server
Declare variables for the server socket, port number, address structures, and message buffer.
Create a UDP socket using socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0).
Check if the socket creation is successful; if not, exit with an error.
Step 2: Configure the server address
Initialize the serveraddr structure using bzero() or memset().
Set the server address family to AF_INET.
Prompt the user to enter the port number and store it in port.
Convert the port number to network byte order using htons().
Set the serverâ€™s IP address to INADDR_ANY (accept connections from any IP).
Step 3: Bind the socket
Call bind() to associate the socket with the specified port.
If bind() fails, print an error message and exit.
Print a message indicating that the server is waiting for a client connection.
Step 4: Receive a message from the client
Initialize the clientaddr structure using bzero() or memset().
Set len to the size of clientaddr.
Call recvfrom() to receive a message from the client.
Print a message confirming that data has been received.
Display the received message.
Step 5: Send a response to the client
Print a message indicating that the server is sending a response.
Call sendto() to send a confirmation message to the client.
Print a message confirming that the response has been sent.
Step 6: Close the connection
Close the server socket using close().
Exit the program.


Algorithm for a UDP Client That Sends and Receives Messages
Step 1: Initialize the client
Declare variables for the client socket, port number, server address structure, and message buffer.
Create a UDP socket using socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0).
Check if the socket creation is successful; if not, exit with an error.
Step 2: Configure the server address
Initialize the serveraddr structure using bzero() or memset().
Set the server address family to AF_INET.
Prompt the user to enter the port number and store it in port.
Convert the port number to network byte order using htons().
Step 3: Send a message to the server
Prompt the user for input (optional).
Send a predefined message ("HI I AM CLIENT...") to the server using sendto().
Print a message confirming that the message has been sent.
Step 4: Receive a response from the server
Call recvfrom() to receive a message from the server.
Print a message indicating that data has been received.
Display the received message.
Step 5: Close the connection
Close the client socket using close().
Exit the program.
